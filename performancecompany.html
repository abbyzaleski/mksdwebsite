      <p class="aboutpc">The goal of the MKSD Company Intensive Program is to encourage dancers to utilize their dance training and education within the community and to provide a solid performance base for any future endeavors. To accomplish this is in a positive manner, we will direct the focus of parents, students, and teachers to the enhancement of the learning experience.</p>

      <p class="aboutpc">MKSD has never been a competition based studio because the competitive dance industry is ever evolving, and the current shift is transitioning towards an extremely competitive environment that lacks focus, direction, standardization, and regulation. We feel that it is in the best interest of the student dancer to have a solid technical background that will provide opportunities for local performances, community theater, college level dance and beyond.</p>

      <p class="aboutpc">Long-term, the technical foundation that dancers will receive in our program will prepare them to be adaptable to various styles and methods of instruction while remaining versatile and humble.</p>

      <p class="aboutpc">The MKSD Company Intensive Program wants to encourage children to focus on their technical dance training, have opportunities to perform quality dance entertainment, and to give back to their community.</p>
